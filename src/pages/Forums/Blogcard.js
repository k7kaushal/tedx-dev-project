Hundreds of celestial bodies revolving around them, reverently. But when us humans looked up at the sky, we saw art. We saw stories. We saw fate. We saw music. We saw peace. And on the dark purple canvas above us covered with shining, twinkling dots, we saw नक्षत्र. At TEDxPICT, this year’s theme “Nakshatra” explores the similarities between our lives and nakshatras." link="https://blogs.tedxpict.com/marcato"/>

               <Card   date="June 3,2021" blogimg={Poetry} name="Poetry is Dead" content="Poetry. Always sort of a mystique. Having been around for aeons, poetry has moved people, igniting a spark of feelings throughout. The poetry-loathing friend is not convinced. But the poetry-loving friend explains the fluidity, the essence, the appeal of poetry. Human ethos is universal, and so is the need to express it. In various forms, in various minds poetry exists and remains resolute. There is no obligation of how it should be; it can be however we want it to be. After all, it stems from the heart and sings a myriad of emotions, heard differently by all. And now, it is more alive than ever." link="https://blogs.tedxpict.com/poetry-is-dead"/>
