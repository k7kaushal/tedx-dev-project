Having an entrepreneurial instinct right from the start, Simran never let go of an opportunity she came across; even the ones disguised as problems. Getting internships right from the age of 17 to channelling her skills for the benefit of society, by volunteering at NGOs. By the time she turned 21, had founded a tech startup ‘Go for Chai’, and was working for a non-profit organization to bridge the gap between companies and laymen. </p>

             <p className={styles.paragraph}>"Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure." says Rowena Ravenclaw, a character renowned for her intelligence. Carrying her spirit, Mr. Prasan Wilfred talks about the importance of intelligence in today’s society. Mr. Wilfred’s definition of intelligence does not necessarily align with the one our education system believes in; he believes knowledge must be inculcated accompanied by fun and not as a punishment. Seeing the plight of kids in his town, he came up with a brilliant idea: teaching kids during their babysitting time by trained amateurs. Interestingly, rather than choosing teachers, he chose older students, as they were much more open to the concept of teaching in a fun way.
